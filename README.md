# IPDynamic - Advanced IP Management for Minecraft Servers
â€‹
Managing disruptive players can be a challenge, especially when they circumvent bans by simply changing a digit in their IP address. In some cases, this may even tempt server owners to consider blocking entire countries, which often comes at the cost of losing legitimate players.

IPDynamic offers a smarter solution by providing dynamic IP filtering, allowing server administrators to block problematic players more effectively without impacting innocent users.
